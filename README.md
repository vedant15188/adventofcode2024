## Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Enjoy!

I've used the following packages, which you can install using `pip`:
1. `numpy`: For easy 2D array manipulation.
2. `tqdm`: For cute progress bars, especially for solutions that aren't necessarily the most efficient.
